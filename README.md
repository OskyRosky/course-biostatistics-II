## 2. Course Objectives

The main objective of this course is to equip students with the analytical and methodological skills required to conduct and evaluate research in health-related fields.

Specifically, the course aims to:

	•	Strengthen understanding of inferential statistics and probabilistic reasoning.
	•	Apply descriptive and inferential statistical methods to real datasets.
	•	Introduce sampling theory and psychometric validation.
	•	Develop skills in quantitative and qualitative research design.
	•	Train students in the use of Excel and SPSS for statistical analysis.
	•	Foster critical reading and analysis of scientific literature in health sciences.

## 3. Quantitative Statistical Methods

A substantial portion of the course focuses on advanced quantitative analysis, including:

	•	Review of statistical foundations and scientific method.
	•	Probability theory, normal distribution, and standardization.
	•	Estimation techniques and hypothesis testing.
	•	Comparison of means and analysis of variance (ANOVA).
	•	Correlation and bivariate regression analysis.
	•	Contingency tables and frequency analysis.
	•	Goodness-of-fit, independence, homogeneity, and Fisher’s exact test.
	•	Introduction to probabilistic sampling methods and sample size determination.

These topics are consistently framed within health and clinical research contexts.

## 4. Data Analysis Tools and Software

The course integrates statistical theory with practical data analysis using professional software:

	•	Microsoft Excel for:
	•	Descriptive statistics
	•	Tables, charts, and pivot tables
	•	Preliminary data exploration
	•	SPSS for:
	•	Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis
	•	Hypothesis testing
	•	Sampling procedures
	•	Psychometric analysis and reliability assessment

Students learn not only how to run analyses, but also how to interpret results correctly in applied research settings.

## 5. Qualitative Research and Mixed Methods

Beyond quantitative analysis, the course introduces qualitative research methodologies, emphasizing their relevance in health sciences:

	•	Foundations of qualitative research.
	•	Comparison between qualitative and quantitative approaches.
	•	Stages of qualitative data analysis.
	•	Core qualitative methodologies:
	•	Phenomenology
	•	Ethnography
	•	Ethnomethodology
	•	Biographical methods
	•	Qualitative data collection techniques:
	•	In-depth interviews
	•	Focus groups and projective techniques
	•	Delphi method
	•	Triangulation

Students analyze scientific articles and present qualitative methods applied to real health research problems.

## 6. Research Projects, Evaluation, and Learning Approach

The course is structured around theory-practice integration:

	•	Continuous practical exercises aligned with lecture topics.
	•	Partial exams and applied evaluations in Excel and SPSS.
	•	Development of research projects, including written reports and presentations.
	•	Individual and group work focused on real-world health research questions.

The teaching methodology emphasizes active participation, critical thinking, and the application of statistical reasoning to professional health scenarios.
